### STM32F4
STM32F411RE Register Based Programming for DS3231 RTC Module
I2C1 on PB8 and PB9, USART2 on PA3 and PA2, are used.

DMA is used to Trasmit via UART.

UART Recieve function will be added soon.


This can run on VSCode, if all required extension tools are added. But, UART,I2C and DS3231 libraries can be easily modified to work with any F4 MCU.
